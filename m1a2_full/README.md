# M1A2 Abrams - Full Auto HEAT and APFSDS Weapons

A Mcheli Overdrive addon that adds two silly weapons to the M1A2 Abrams, aswell as the no roof-mounted machine guns variant and the modified tan texture without combat identify panels (because it ruins their look for me. If you don't like it then remove the textures folder inside this addon's contents).

# Installation

After downloading this repository, extract the zip file then place the m1a2_full folder into the mcheli_addons folder in your .minecraft folder.
The directory should look like this: ./minecraft/mcheli_addons/m1a2_full/assets/mcheli/...

# Credits

EMB4 for the original code of the Abrams.

Regex for the overdrive code of the same tank and the modified texture.

DICE for the tank fire sounds from their game Battlefield 3/4.
